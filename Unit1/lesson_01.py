# Okay, you said hello to the world with a "print" statement, how do we make something useful?

# Every program in any language (Python included) use something called a "Variable" to store data
# Variables allow you to store a piece of data and reuse it whenever you want.


# To "declare" a variable, you need three parts:
# 1. The name of the variable - in this case I'll create a variable called my_number
# 2. The equal sign - this is called the "assignment operator", it assigns the value to the variable
# 3. The value of the variable - this is the data you store, in this case it's the number 10

my_number = 10



# Try creating your own variable, name it however you want, and assign it a value.


...
