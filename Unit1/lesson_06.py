# There are a few more concepts we need to learn before we can start to make programs that are interactive.
# Learning Python is the same as learning a new language, while it's based on English, it has a lot of rules of its own.
# Next we're going to learn about "syntax" and "indentation".

# Python is really picky about how you write your code.
# Computers don't understand what you mean, they only understand what they already know.
# Syntax is how you write code so that the computer can understand it.

# For example, if you write:
print Hello World!


# Try running the code above.
# The computer will not understand what you mean. Often you will get an "error" or "traceback" in the console.
# Try fixing the code above so that the error is fixed!

# This process is called "debugging".
# The nice thing is, there's no downside to making mistakes, the computer will tell you what you did wrong and how to fix it most of the time!

# Indentation is another important concept.
# Indentation is the space at the beginning of a line of code.
# It's used to tell the computer what code belongs to what.

# For example, if you write:
    print("Hello World!")

# The computer will not understand what you mean.
# Try fixing the code above so that the error is fixed!





# Vocab:
# 1. Syntax - the rules for how you write code (Just like grammar, don't forget to use punctuation and check your spelling/capitalization!)
# 2. Indentation - the space at the beginning of a line of code (Just like paragraphs, don't forget to use spaces! Tab is easier to use than spaces but programmers usually use spaces... for whatever reason.)
# 3. Debugging - the process of finding and fixing errors in your code
