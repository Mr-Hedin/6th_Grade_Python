# Now that you know about variables, we can start to use them in a useful way.
# We're going to play mad libs with variables!

# Mad libs is a game where you fill in the blanks with a story, and then read the story out loud - the story is usually pretty ridiculous and fun to read.

# First, let's create a couple variables that store a string:

noun_1 = ... # Nouns are things. Like a dog. Or a rock.

noun_2 = ...

noun_3 = ... # Make this a plural noun! Like frogs. Or rocks.

verb_1 = ... # Remember, verbs are things you do! Like run. Or jump.

verb_2 = ...

adjective_1 = ... # Adjectives are descriptions. Like big. Or small. Or red.

adjective_2 = ...

integer_1 = ... # Integers are whole numbers. Like 1. Or 2. Or 3.

# Now, let's create a story in our console using the variables we created!
# We're going to use the print() command to print out the story, and the variables we created to fill in the blanks!

print("Once upon a time, there was a ")
print(adjective_1)
print(noun_1)
print("who loved to")
print(verb_1)
print("and")
print(verb_2)
print("One day, they went to the")
print(noun_2)
print("and ate ")
print(integer_1)
print(adjective_2)
print(noun_3)
print(".")




# There are much more complex ways to do this which would allow you to input the variables from the user or customize the format of the story, but this is a good start!
