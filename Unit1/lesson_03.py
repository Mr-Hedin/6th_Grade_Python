# Variables can store all sorts of data. In order to understand how useful a variable is, we need to understand how to store different types of data.
# There are FOUR main types of data:
# 1. Strings - these are just words and letters! Technically, anything in quotes is a string. like this: "Hello World!"
# 2. Integers - these are whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.
# 3. Floats - these are decimal numbers, like 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, etc.
# 4. Booleans - these are True or False values. More on this later!

# Let's create a variable that stores a string:

my_string = ...

# Now, let's create a variable that stores an integer:

my_integer = ...

# Now, let's create a variable that stores a float:

my_float = ...

# Now, let's create a variable that stores a boolean:

my_boolean = ...


# If you ever want to know what the value of a variable is, you can print it out!
# If you aren't sure what type of data a variable is storing, you can use the 'type()' command to find out!
# You can even combine the two to find out the type of data a variable is storing and its value!

# This is the "value" of the variable - it should say whatever words you typed next to the equal sign!
print(my_string)

# This is the "type" of the variable - it should say "str" in the console to let you know it's a string!
print(type(my_string))



# Try printing the value and type of the other variables!
print(...)
print(type(...))

print(...)
print(type(...))

print(...)
print(type(...))



# ------------------------------Vocab--------------------------------
# 1. String - a sequence of characters in quotes
# 2. Integer - a whole number
# 3. Float - a decimal number
# 4. Boolean - a True or False value

# Commands:
# 1. print() - prints the value of a variable to the console
# 2. type() - returns the type of a variable
