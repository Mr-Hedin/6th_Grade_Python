# In order to use a variable, you first declare and assign the variable a value
# Then, you can "reference" that variable to read the data you stored

# We're going to create a variable called 'words' that stores the data "Hello World!", then reference that variable to print out its data

words = "Hello World!"

print(words)

# You should see "Hello World!" printed out in the console below!

# Now try creating your own variable and assigning it a value!

... = ...
print(...)
