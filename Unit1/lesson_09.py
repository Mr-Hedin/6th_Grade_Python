# Let's try customizing our student object!

import example_code

my_student = example_code.student("NAME HERE")


# First, add a couple of classes to our student's schedule!

... # Add a history class with a grade of 80
... # Add a math class with a grade of 90
... # Add a science class with a grade of 70

# Next, try printing out the student's classes and grades!

... # Use the print_classes() method

# Now try to make our student do some homework, remember, you can add an argument to this method that tells it how many times to do the homework!

... # Use the do_homework() method

# Try printing out the student's classes and grades again to see your student's grade change.

...


# Finally, let's try to calculate the student's GPA! Use the student.get_gpa() method to do this.

... 

# Try printing out the student's GPA to see if it's correct.
