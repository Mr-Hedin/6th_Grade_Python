# This is a Python file, it is a text file that will later be read by the Python interpreter in your computer to execute the code.

# Python files are plain text files that contain Python code. 
# To get started, you can create something called a "Hello World" program. Every programmer starts with this program. 
# Yes, it literally just says "Hello World" and then ends - ya gotta start somewhere. 


# Try typing the following code into your file:
# print("Hello World")

# If you're working in a Jupyter Notebook, you can run the code by clicking the "Run" button or by pressing Shift then Enter at the same time.
# Otherwise, you can run the code by typing "python lesson_00.py" in your terminal and pressing enter.

# if you see ... in the code, that means you need to fill in the blank.
