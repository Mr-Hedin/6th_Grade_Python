# The code below is an "import" statement.
# It lets us use code that someone else has written. We'll learn more about this later.
import example_code

# Next we're going to learn about doing things in Python.
# Storing data is incredibly useful, but it's not the only thing we can do with it!
# You can execute commands in Python using "functions" and "methods".

# An object is a thing. Like a student. Or a class.

student = example_code.student("Bob the Destroyer")

# We just created a student object! 
# The object can store data about the student called "properties" or "attributes".

# Objects attributes can be accessed using the dot operator.
print("GPA:")
print(student.gpa)


# Try printing the student's name attribute.
print(...)

# Try printing the student's age attribute.
print(...)

# 1. Object - A thing. Like a student.
# 2. Argument - Extra information the method needs to do its job. Like the class the student is doing homework for.
# 3. Attribute - Some data that belongs to the object. Like a student's name.
