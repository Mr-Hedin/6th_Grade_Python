# CircuitPython_Intro_Modules
- The current versions are work-in-progress, some code may not align with what was actually used in class
- If something is broken that you need, just let Mr. Hedin know!
- In order to run any of these files, you will need a microcontroller like the Raspberry Pi Pico W with CircuitPython installed

- Ask for a carpool pass to come work with the microcontrollers from class!

# Project
- The project for this unit is to create a web server that hosts at least two unique web pages
- module_8_web_dashboard.py contains a starter kit of code to set up your server, start with the code from this file!
- a passing project includes a unique SSID & password, two unique functions that display web pages, and at least one LED turned on when you visit one of the web pages.
