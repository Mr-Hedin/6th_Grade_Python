# Microcontrollers!

#### One of my favorite things to do is to program little computers known as "microcontrollers". I use CircuitPython to create quick and simple gadgets that can do a variety of really cool things. From little web servers to Infrared remote controls, this section of my github has some pretty cool examples and lessons on how to use a microcontroller.

#### Microcontrollers are special since they allow you to control the flow of electricity to their 'pins' which means you can control other electronic devices using the microcontroller as the 'brain' of the operation!

#### In my class, you'll have an opportunity to work with some microcontrollers once you've learned a bit of regular Python. We'll create text displays, infrared remotes, learn the fundamentals of circuitry in electronics, and much much more!

## Materials

#### If you're following along in class, we're likely using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

#### This device doesn't have an operating system like you're used to. It needs to be programmed from the ground up using CircuitPython - a different, smaller version of Python meant for microcontrollers.
#### If you think these are awesome and want to make projects of your own, microcontrollers are super cheap and available online to order!



#### This shows the pinout, it looks a little daunting, but we really only use a couple of the pins at a time.

### Alternatively, you might want to try out the ESP32, a faster microcontroller with some fancy bells and whistles like 'ESPNow' - a way to connect your microcontrollers to each other without WiFi access!

#### We use the adafruit QT Py S3 in class. It's much smaller than a Raspberry Pi Pico, which means fewer pins to work with. However, it also has I2C port which lets us plug into some devices without having to worry as much about the wiring, so we can focus a bit more on the code!

#### Here's the pinout for that little dude in case you need it:

## Resources

#### If you end up just as enthralled by these weird little computers as I did, here's where you can find a WEALTH of resources about them and where to buy them/their components.

[`Adafruit Store`](https://www.adafruit.com/)
<br>
[`Adafruit Learn` - SO many guides to building zany and awesome microcontroller projects](https://learn.adafruit.com/)
<br>
#### Just between you and me, if the prices are a bit high, you can find a ton of cheap microcontrollers that are effectively the same on aliexpress... Your mileage may vary there, but I've found most to be nearly identical to their adafruit counterparts for significantly cheaper!
